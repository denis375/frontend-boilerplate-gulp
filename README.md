# Front-end Boilerplate using Gulp 4 and Sass

Using a boilerplate when you're starting a website project can save you a lot of time. You can get up and running in just a minute or two instead of having to start from scratch or copy and paste from previous projects.

I wanted to share my boilerplate that I use for simple front-end websites that use HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. I use Gulp 4 to compile, prefix, and minify files.

## Quickstart

* Clone or download this Git repo onto your computer
* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you don't have it yet
* Run `npm install`
* Run `gulp` to run the default Gulp task

## Gulp is configured to run the following functions:

* Compile SCSS files to CSS
* Autoprefix and minify the CSS file
* Concatenate JS files
* Uglify JS files
* Move final CSS and JS files to the `/dist` folder
